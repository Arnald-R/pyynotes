```python
p = int(input('Enter the first number:'))
```

    Enter the first number: 56



```python
q = int(input('Enter the second number:'))
```

    Enter the second number: 45



```python
r = int(input('Enter the number of bits to be shifted towards left and right: '))
```

    Enter the number of bits to be shifted towards left and right:  3



```python
print('outcomes of bitwise &: ', p & q)
```

    outcomes of bitwise &:  40



```python
print('outcomes of bitwise |: ',p | q)
```

    outcomes of bitwise |:  61



```python
print('outcomes of bitwise ^: ',p^q)
```

    outcomes of bitwise ^:  21



```python
print('outcomes of bitwise ~: ',~p)
```

    outcomes of bitwise ~:  -57



```python
print('outcommes of bitwise ~: ',~q)
```

    outcommes of bitwise ~:  -46



```python
print('Outcome of bitwise <<: ', p << r) 
```

    Outcome of bitwise <<:  448



```python
print('Outcome of bitwise >>: ', p >> r)
```

    Outcome of bitwise >>:  7
